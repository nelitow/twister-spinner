          <h3> About the Twister Game </h3>
          <p> Twister is a physical skill game produced by the Milton Bradley Company and Winning Moves,
          which was introduced to the American National Toy Hall of Fame.
          It is thrown on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or floor.
          The rug has six rows of colored circles with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green and blue. <br>
          A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player should place his hand or foot.
          The spinner is divided into four labeled groups: left foot, right foot, left hand and right hand.
          Each of these four combinations is divided into four cores (red, yellow, green and blue). That replaces this site. <br>
          After spinning, a combination is called (for example: right hand in yellow),
          and players must move the corresponding hand or foot to a circle of the correct color. <br>
          In a two-player game, two people cannot have one hand or one foot in the same circle. <br>
          Calculated for the scarcity of colored circles, players often need to place in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall.
          A person is eliminated when falling or when elbow or knee touches the mat. <br>
          There is no limit to how many can play at once, but more than four is ideal.
